# replace-macaddress_in_LINUX
Shell script to modify identity of your network card. Allowing a new identity for the linux user's network card.


Firstly, tell the network card model that you want to update your mac!


Then choose from the following options:

1 - To manually modify the mac.

2 - To automatically change the mac. (Note that this option may require the installation of dependencies).


Then complete the operation with enter.

Improvements to the script are welcome!

Good luck in school!
